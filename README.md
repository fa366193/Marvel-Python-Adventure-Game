# Marvel-Python-Adventure-Game

Calling all Marvel nerds! Play as Ant-man in the text adventure game I just created in python and help the Avengers win the Infinity War and finish End Game. 

This is a survival adventure text game. Save the universe or lose half of the universe's population.
    As Ant-man, you will attempt to retrieve your stone and help the Avengers beat Thanos.
    
    
    
    This adventure has 3 missions:
    
    1. Retrieve the space stone by traveling back in time: player must choose the correct hallways to go through to find the stone
    
    2. Fight with the Wakandans: The player must guess the correct number between 1 and 4 to reduce or enlarge size of Antman character and defeat the alien army 
    
    3. Defeat Thanos: The player must make the correct choice to complete this level and finish the game.
   
   
   
   
 Disclaimers/bugs: When you restart the game after completion, you are taken back to the loop on Mission 1.
       You never really exit that loop, even though there is a break statement.
